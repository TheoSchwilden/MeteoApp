# MeteoApp
I created a simple weather application using HTML, CSS, REACT, and the OpenWeatherMap API. The app allows users to enter the name of a city and instantly retrieve weather information for that city.


## INSTALLATION

Enter your API key in app.jsx
[https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
```
npm install


npm run dev
